The 'raw_input' Function:

Python provides basic functions and methods necessary to manipulate files by default.
You can do most of the file manipulation using file object.

    THE 'open' Functions

before you can read or write a file, you have to open it using Python's built-in
'open()' function. This function creates a file object, which would be utilized to
call other support methods associated with it.
Syntax:
    file object = open(file_name [, access_mod] [, buffering])
    
Here are parameter detail:
    + file_name: The file_name argument is a string value that contains the name of 
                 the file that you want to access.
    + access_mode: The access_mode determines the mode in which the file haas to be opened. 
                   i.e read, write, append, etc. A complete list of possible value s is given
                   below in the table. This is optional parameter and the default file access 
                   mode is read(r)

    + buffering: If the buffering value is set to 0, no buffering takes place. If the buffering 
    value is 1, line buffering is performed while accessing a file. If you specify the buffering 
    value as an integer greater than 1, then buffering action is performed with the indicated buffer size.
    If negative, the buffer size is the system default( default behavior)

===============================================================================================
Modes           Description
 r          Opens a file for reading only. The file pointer is placed at the begining of the file.
            This is the default mode.

 rb         Opens a file for reading onl in binary format. The file pointer is place at the begin of the file. 
            This is the default mode.

 r+        Opens a file for both reading and writing. Teh file pointer placed at the begin of the file. 

 rb+       Opens a file for both reading and writing in binary format. The file pointer placed at the beginning of the file

 w         Opens a file for writing only. Overwrites the file if the file exits. If the file does not exist, creates a new file
           for writing.
 
 wb        Opens a file for writin only. Overwrites the file if the file exists. If the file doed not exist, creates a new file for 
           writing.

 w+        Open a file for both writing and reading. Overwrites the file if the file exist. If the file does not exist, 
           creates a new file for writing.

 wb+      Open the file for both writing and reading. Overwrite the file if the file exist. If the file does not exist, create a new 
          file for reading and writing.

 a        Open the file for appending. The file pointer is at the end of the file if the file exists. That is, the file is in the append
          mode. If the file node exist, it creates a new file for writing.
        
 ab       Open a file for appending in binary format. The file pointer is at the end of the file if the file exists. That is, the file is in 
          the append mode. If the file does not exist. It create a new file for writing.

 a+      Open a file for appeding and reading. The file pointer is at the end of the file if the file exists. The file open in the deppend mode. 
         If the file does not exist, it creates a new file for writing.

 ab+     Open a file for appending and reading in binary mode. The file pointer is at the end of the file if the file exists. The file open in append
         mode. If the file does not exist, it creates a new file for reading and writing.

===============================================================================================
The file Object Attributes:

Once a file is opened adn you have one file object, you can get various information releted to that file.close
Here is a list of all atributes related to file object

    Attribute           Decription 
 file.closed            Return true if file is close, false otherwise
 file.mode              Return access mode with which file was opened.
 file.name              Return name of the file.close
 file.softspace         Returns false if space explicitky required with print, true otherwise.

fo = open("foo.txt", "wb")
print "Name of the file: ", fo.name
print "Closed or not :", fo.closed
print "Opening mode: ", fo.mode
print "Softspace flag: ", fo.softspace


"""
The close() Mothod
The 'close()' mothod of a file object flushes any unwritten infomataion and closes
the file object, after which no more writing can be done.

Python automatically closes a file when the reference object of the file is reasigned 
to another file. It is a good practice to use the 'close()' method to close a file.

Syntax: 'fileObject.close()'
"""

print "Closed or not :", fo.closed

"""
Reading and writing Files
The 'file' object provides a set of access methods to make our lives easier.
We would see how to use 'read()' adnd "write()" methods to read and writes files.

The write() Method.
The 'write()' method writes string to an open file. It is important to note that
Python strings can have binary data and not just text.

The write() method does not add a newline character ('\n') to the end of string.

Syntax: fileObject.write(string)
"""

#Open a file 
fo = open ("foo.txt", "wb")
fo.write("Python is a great language.\nYeah its great!!\n")

#Close open file 
fo.close()

"""
The read() Mothod
The read() method reads string from an open file. It is important to note that Python string can have binary data, Apart from text.

Syntax 
    fileObject.read([count])

    Here, passed parameter is the number of btes to be read from the opend file. This method starts reading from begining of the file,
    and if count is missing, then it tries to read as much as posible, maybe until the end of file.

Str = fo.read(10)

    File Posibles
The 'tell()' method tells you the current position within the file. in other worlds, the next read or write will 
occur at that many bytes from the begining of the file

The 'seek(offset[, from])' method changes the current file position. The offset argumen indicates the number of bytes to be move.
The from argument specifies the reference position from where the byte are to be moved.
    If from iss set to 0, it means use thee beginning of the file as the reference position and 1 means use the current position 
    as the reference position and if it is set to 2 then the end of the file would be taken as the reference position.
