#Sometimes, you may need to perform conversion between the built-in type.
#To covert between types, you simple use the type name as a function

#There are several built-in function to perform conversion from one data type to another.
#These functions return a new object representingg the converted value.

#   Function                | Description
#   int (x [,base])         | Converts x to an integer. base specifies the base if x is a string
#   long(x [,base])         | Converts x to long integer. base specifies the base if x is a string.
#   float(x [,base])        | Converts x to float-point number.
#   complex(real [,image])  | Create a complex number.
#   str(x)                  | Coverts object x to a string representation.
#   repe(x)                 | Converts object x to expression string
#   eval(str)               | Evaluates a string and return a object.
#   tuple(s)                | Converts s to a tuple
#   list(s)                 | Converts s to a list
#   set(s)                  | Converts s to s set
#   dict(d)                 | Create a dictionary. d mus be a sequence of (key, value) tuples
#   frozenset(s)            | Converts s to a frozen set
#   chr(x)                  | Converts an integer to a character
#   unichr(x)               | Converts an integer to a Unicode character
#   ord(x)                  | Converts a single character to its integer value
#   hex(x)                  | Converts an integer to a hexadecimal string
#   oct(x)                  | Converts an integer to a octal string
