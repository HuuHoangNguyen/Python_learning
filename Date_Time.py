=========================================================================================================================
A Python program can handle date and time in several ways. Converting between date format is a common chore for computers.
Python's time and calendar modules help track dates and times

What is Tick?
Time intervals are floating numbers in units of seconds. Particular instants in time are 
expressed in seconds since 12:00am, January 1, 1997(epoch)

There is a popular time module availabel in Python which provides fuctions for working
with times, and for converting between representation. The function time.time() 
returns the currrent system time in ticks sine 12:00am, January 1, 1970(epoch)
"""

import time     #This is required to include time module
ticks = time.time()
print "Number of ticks since 12:00am, January 1, 1970 : ", ticks

"""
=========================================================================================================================
Date arithmetic is easy to do with ticks. However, dates before the epoch cannot be represented in this format
Dates in the far future also cannot be represented this way - the cutoff point is sometime is 2038 for UNX and Windows

What is TimeTuple?
